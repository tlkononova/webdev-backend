O beautiful wine-bearer, bring forth the cup and put it to my lips<br>Path of love seemed easy at first, what came was many hardships.<br>With its perfume, the morning breeze unlocks those beautiful locks<br>The curl of those dark ringlets, many hearts to shreds strips.<br>In the house of my Beloved, how can I enjoy the feast<br>Since the church bells call the call that for pilgrimage equips.<br>With wine color your robe, one of the old Magi’s best tips<br>Trust in this traveler’s tips, who knows of many paths and trips.<br>The dark midnight, fearful waves, and the tempestuous whirlpool<br>How can he know of our state, while ports house his unladen ships.<br>I followed my own path of love, and now I am in bad repute<br>How can a secret remain veiled, if from every tongue it drips?<br>If His presence you seek, Hafiz, then why yourself eclipse?<br>Stick to the One you know, let go of imaginary trips.
