"O wine-bearer brighten my cup with the wine<br>O minstrel say good fortune is now mine.<br>The face of my Beloved is reflected in my cup<br>Little you know why with wine, I always myself align.<br>Eternal is the one whose heart has awakened to Love<br>This is how Eternal Records my life define.<br>So proud are the tall beauties of the world<br>Outshines all the others this handsome spruce of mine.<br>O breeze if by chance you pass through friendly gardens<br>From me to my Beloved, please give a sign;<br>Ask why you choose to forget my name?<br>Will come the one to whom an audience you decline.<br>Intoxication pleases my Beloved and my Lord<br>To the wine, they would assign, my life's design.<br>What if on Judgment Day, no favor would be gained<br>From eating bread and leaving a forbidden water so fine?<br>Hafiz, let a tear drop or two leave your eyes,<br>May we ensnare the Bird of Union, divine.<br>The sea of the skies and the gondola of the moon<br>With the grace of the Master, radiantly shine."
