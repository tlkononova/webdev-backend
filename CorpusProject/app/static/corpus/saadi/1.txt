"I have heard that Jemshid, of happy disposition, inscribed on a tablet at the head of a fountain:<br>Many, like ourselves, have breathed at this fountain, and departed, and closed their eyes upon it.<br>They captured the world by courage, or violence, but carried away with them nothing to the grave.<br>They departed each one, and of that which they had tilled nothing remained to them, save a good or an evil name.<br>When thine enemy hath fallen into thy hands, grieve him not further; he hath already tasted enough of sorrow.<br>Better hold in thy keeping a discomfited enemy alive, than to have on thy neck the stain of his blood."
